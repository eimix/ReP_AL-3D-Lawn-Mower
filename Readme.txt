ReP_AL-3D-Lawn-Mower
Code and Files for the ReP_AL 3D Printed Lawn Mower
---------------------------------------------------


Arduino Code
------------
The mower software is in the folder Mower Arduino Code:  
MEGA - Needs to be uploaded to the Arduino MEGA 
NANO - Needs to be uploaded to the Arduino NANO   
(I needed to use the "old bootloader" option in the Arduino IDE to get the sketch to upload to the NANO)
Perimeter Wire - Sender_station_V1 needs to be uploaded to the Arduino in the perimeter wire transmitter.


Libraries
---------
All the libraries I used for the Arduino Code can be found in this folder


Test sketches folder
--------------------
They are designed to test the indiviual components in your build to see if they are working. 
Ihe idea is to debug the components indicudually so you are faster in completing the project.


CAD Data 
--------
is fouind in the ReP_AL Mower STEP Files Folder
